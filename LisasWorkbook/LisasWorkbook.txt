Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters.

* There are n chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from 1 to n.
* The i-th chapter has t(i) problems, numbered from 1 to t(i).
* Each page can hold up to k problems. There are no empty pages or unnecessary spaces, so only 
the last page of a chapter may contain fewer than k problems.
* Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.
* The page number indexing starts at 1.

Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number 
where it's located. Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of special problems?

Note: See the diagram in the Explanation section for more details.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers n and k — the number of chapters and the maximum number of problems per page respectively. 
The second line contains n integers t(1),t(2),...,t(n), where t(i) denotes the number of problems in the i-th chapter.

Constraints
1<=n,k,t(i)<=100

Output Format

Print the number of special problems in Lisa's workbook.

Sample Input

5 3  
4 2 6 1 10
Sample Output
